## Downloading the Latest Code

To retrieve the most recent version of this project after an update has been pushed to GitHub, run the following command in your local clone:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

If you have not cloned the repository yet, you can obtain everything in one step:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Replace `<repository-url>` with the HTTPS or SSH address of the repository (for example, `https://github.com/username/autismclicker.git`). Once the clone finishes, you will have all of the files—including the updated `app.py`—on your machine. You can re-run `git pull origin main` in that directory whenever new changes are published.
